 * Markdown plugin configuration for assistant chat bubbles.
 *
 * Assistant responses are passed to react-markdown untouched — there is deliberately no pre-parse
 * normalisation of maths delimiters. `$...$` and `$$...$$` are the only maths delimiters, and
 * remark-math owns them exclusively; `\[...\]` is used by the backend for citations and source
 * attributions, so it must render as literal text.
 *
 * Exported so the rendering tests exercise exactly the configuration the bubble uses.
